# allsky-website
Web interface displaying an image from an allsky camera.

## Update
Please make sure to remove this line from your `virtualsky.json` as it has put a strain on Stuart Lowe's lookup service over time.
```
"objects": "M42;M45;M31;M51;M81",

## Brief overview

**controller.js** contains the logic of the website. It has a timeout that refreshes the image after a certain amount of time. It also grabs the space weather from NOAA and displays it at the top. The constellation overlay is also generated here.

**videos/index.php** lists the timelapses in the videos/ directory.

**keograms/index.php** lists the keograms in the keograms/ directory

**startrails/index.php** lists the startrails in the startrails/ directory

**virtualsky.json** contains settings to generate the constellations overlay (lat, long, etc).

**config.js** is the only file you need to modify. The content is described below.

## Configuration

To configure the website for your own location, you will need to edit the `config.js` file.
