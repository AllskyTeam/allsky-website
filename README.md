# Allsky Website ![v2022-03-01+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2022.03.01+-green.svg) 
The "allsky-website" package allows you to display your images on a website, either on your Pi or on another machine. It can optionally add an overlay of constellations and other objects, as well as optional Aurora data from NOAA.

## Update
This version of the website works best with Allsky camera software version **v2022-03-01** or newer.


## Installation
The installation script for installing on a Pi is documented on the [main Allsky GitHub page](https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky).

Once installed, there are several [configuration variables](https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/allsky-website-Settings) you'll want to change.
