# Allsky Website ![Release 0.8.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-0.8.3-green.svg) 
The "allsky-website" package allows you to display your images on a website, either on your Pi or on another machine. It can optionally add an overlay of constellations and other objects, as well as optional Aurora data from NOAA.

## Update
This version of the WebUI works best with Allsky camera software version 0.8.3 or newer.


## Installation
The installation script for installing on a Pi is documented on the [main Allsky GitHub page](https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky).

Once installed, there are several [configuration variables](https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/allsky-website-Settings) you'll want to change.
